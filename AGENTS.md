# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `WaveDudeNext/`: shared .NET 10 library; model, CPU/OpenCL engines, optical parts, rendering, probes, frame storage and exports.
- `WaveDudeNext.WPF/`: Windows desktop application, including controls, docking, localisation and document generation.
- `WaveDudeNext.Server/`: Linux-runnable ASP.NET Core host with in-memory workspace creation and SSE subscriptions; no project APIs yet.
- `WaveDudeNext.Server.Tests/`: MSTest workspace service and HTTP integration tests, included in `WaveDudeNext.Server.slnx`.
- `web/`: npm-managed Preact/TypeScript/Vite frontend, currently a starter. `src/` contains components; `public/` contains static assets.
- `_tools/library_check/`: console verification harness, outside the solution. `_tools/ui_check/`: Windows PowerShell UI checks and fixtures.
- `Examples/`, `Assets/`, `MANUAL.md`: example projects, documentation images and user documentation.
- `PLAN.md`: implemented workspace slice and planned Linux server and JSON API architecture.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use the .NET 10 SDK selected by `global.json`, Node.js 24/npm and Just. [Justfile](Justfile) is the entry point for portable builds; run `just` to list commands. From a fresh checkout, run `just restore`, then `just build`. Recipes run from the repository root, including when invoked from a subdirectory.

- `just restore`: restore the portable server solution and install locked frontend dependencies with `npm ci`.
- `just build`: build the portable server solution in Release with zero warnings, then check TypeScript and build the production frontend.
- `just build-server` / `just restore-server`: build or restore the server, shared library and workspace tests without WPF.
- `just test-server`: run the workspace service and HTTP API tests.
- `just dev-server`: run the workspace API with `dotnet watch` on loopback port 5080; Vite proxies `/api` there.
- `just build-library` / `just build-web`: build only the changed component.
- `just restore-library` / `just restore-web`: restore only that component's dependencies.
- `just dev-web` / `just preview-web`: run Vite for development or inspect the built frontend.

The server currently implements empty workspaces and SSE only. Portable library checks and further API tests will be added as those features arrive; `just build` verifies compilation and frontend bundling, while `just test-server` checks workspace behaviour. See `PLAN.md` for the remaining test work. GPU verification is optional and separate from the CPU build.

The WPF application and current verification harnesses require Windows:

- `dotnet build WaveDudeNext.sln`: build the desktop solution; require zero warnings.
- `dotnet run --project WaveDudeNext.WPF`: launch the desktop application.
- `dotnet run --project _tools/library_check -c Release`: verify library behaviour; append `-- export` for export checks.
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File _tools/ui_check/KeyboardCheck.ps1`: run a targeted UI check; choose the script matching the change.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Follow `.editorconfig`: C# uses tabs and Allman braces; project XML uses two spaces. Preserve the frontend's two-space indentation and existing TSX style.

Use PascalCase for C# types/public members and Preact components. Prefer concise expression-bodied accessors without `this.`. C# source files need the prescribed license header; document public APIs with `///` comments. Build-time Roslyn diagnostics enforce these rules.

Use WPF commands and bindings, with `DynamicResource` for theme brushes and strings. Keep controls keyboard-accessible. Use British UI spelling, except `license`.

## Testing Guidelines

Verification uses custom console and PowerShell harnesses. Name UI scripts `<Feature>Check.ps1`. Run library checks for library changes and targeted UI checks when their workflows change. Preserve failing output; avoid repeated harness runs without new evidence. No frontend test/lint script or coverage threshold is configured.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

History favours descriptive subjects explaining behaviour; release commits use `Version <number>: ...`, while some maintenance commits use `chore:`. Keep changes focused. PRs should explain the problem, resulting behaviour and validation, link relevant issues, and include screenshots for visual changes.

Read `CLAUDE.md` for established decisions. Agents must obtain explicit authorisation for commits and other Git mutations, keep scratch files outside the repository, and avoid unsolicited design changes.
