# Building the browser runtime

`WaveDudeNext.Wasm` is an additional .NET 10 browser project referencing `WaveDudeNext.csproj`
and its ordinary NuGet dependencies. The existing library, WPF project and desktop solution
retain their own build commands. Neither ASP.NET Core nor Blazor is used for the browser target.

## Prerequisites

Use Docker with BuildKit, Node.js 24/npm and Just. Browser builds do not need .NET or a Wasm
workload installed on the host. Native library and desktop builds still use the SDK selected
by `global.json`.

Just uses `cmd.exe` on Windows, so these recipes do not require Git Bash or Cygwin.
The scripts under `_tools/scripts/` use only Node built-ins and can run before `npm ci`.
For example, `node _tools/scripts/just-wasm-build.mjs` builds the runtime without
`web/node_modules`. The scripts resolve the checkout from their own location. Frontend builds
still need `just restore-web`; snapshot deployment also requires Git, rsync and SSH access.

`_tools/build/Dockerfile` pins Microsoft's .NET SDK 10.0.100 Ubuntu Noble image by digest, matching
the feature band in `global.json`. Its cached toolchain layer installs Python, libatomic and
`wasm-tools` using the manifests shipped with that SDK (`--skip-manifest-update`). Workload
installation happens only inside the image. The first build downloads a substantial native
toolchain; later builds reuse it. Update the SDK image version/digest and check `global.json`
together when upgrading the browser toolchain.

The local checkout is the build context; there is no clone. `_tools/build/Dockerfile.dockerignore` admits only
`WaveDudeNext/`, `WaveDudeNext.Wasm/`, `global.json`, `Directory.Build.props` and `.editorconfig`,
excluding host `bin/` and `obj/` directories. The Dockerfile explicitly mounts those inputs
read-only under `/src/`. Restore and publish write intermediates under `/build/artifacts/`
and the complete runtime bundle under `/out/`. NuGet packages use a BuildKit cache. Source
edits invalidate the publish layer while retaining the toolchain and project restore layers.

## Build and development

From the repository root:

```sh
just restore
just build
just dev-web
```

`just build-wasm` publishes Release AOT code with Wasm SIMD. The runtime is single-threaded and
uses invariant globalisation. Docker's `wasm` stage contains only the SDK's published
`wwwroot/` bundle. BuildKit exports it to a temporary host directory; after a successful build,
the recipe replaces `web/public/wasm/` with that output. A failed build keeps the existing
bundle, and replacing the directory removes stale fingerprinted files. Temporary output is
cleaned up on exit. No writable source mount or root-owned host build output is needed.
`just build-web` publishes Wasm first, then runs TypeScript and Vite; the deployable site is
`web/dist/`. Vite serves `public/` directly in development and copies it unchanged in production.
Keep the complete `wasm/` directory together: .NET's loader expects its framework modules,
manifest, assemblies and Wasm files at their relative URLs.

`just dev-web` publishes the runtime before starting Vite. After C# changes, run `just build-wasm`
again and reload the page. Frontend changes use Vite's normal development loop. `just preview-web`
serves an existing production build. `just build-library` builds only the shared library and
does not require the browser workload. For a frontend-only rebuild after publishing Wasm, use
`npm --prefix web run build`.

The complete generated `web/public/wasm/` bundle is ignored by Git, including its JavaScript
loaders. Generate it on a fresh checkout and regenerate it after C# changes with
`just build-wasm`. `just restore-wasm` warms the container's dependency layers without
publishing; `just restore` also runs `npm ci` on the host. `CompressionEnabled=false` disables
`.gz` and `.br` sidecars; the deployment web server handles response compression. `web/dist/`,
`bin/` and `obj/` remain ignored. Build sources belong in `WaveDudeNext.Wasm/`, outside `_tools/`.

To export the assets directly to another location, run from the repository root:

```sh
docker build --file _tools/build/Dockerfile --target wasm --output type=local,dest=/absolute/path/to/wasm-output .
```

The context `.` is the local repository; the destination is a host path. The direct Docker
command merges files into its destination, so use an empty directory to avoid stale runtime
files. `just build-wasm` handles replacement automatically.

## Runtime boundary

Import `loadWaveDude` from `web/src/Wasm/Runtime.ts` to initialise the runtime lazily:

```ts
const runtime = await loadWaveDude()
const peak = runtime.SmokeTest()
```

The loader uses Vite's `BASE_URL`, including a deployment prefix. It dynamically imports the
published `wasm/main.mjs` without bundling or rewriting .NET's internal modules. The JavaScript
host creates one runtime per JS context and obtains the `[JSExport]` methods from the assembly.
`SmokeTest()` executes 16 steps of the real CPU solver and returns a finite, positive peak field
amplitude. `StartSimulation(projectJson, maxFrames)` reads and normalises a canvas project using the shared
model, paints its optical parts and creates the CPU solver. It returns width, height, bounded
step count, frame interval and frame count. The export increases the interval to fit the caller's
frame budget without changing the input project. The run ends at its last sampled step.
`NextFrame()` advances to the next capture
and returns two binary half-float planes: field, then square-root intensity. `EndSimulation()`
releases the engine and snapshot. Image scenes report an error until image delivery is connected.

Active probes are installed through the shared `ProbeSampler`, sampled after every solver step,
and integrated using the shared `ProbeCollector` and engine. `GetProbeFrame()` returns the latest
capture's binary probe packet: little-endian int32 probe count and steps completed; per active probe
in project order, int32 point sample count, int32 profile count (-1 for point probes), float64 line
length in canvas pixels, then float32 point samples and profile values. Point samples cover only
steps since the previous capture; line profiles belong to the current capture. Reading the packet
does not drain it. The worker stores it after the two half-float planes in the same closed frame file.
Integrated intensity excludes values before the probe's start step.

`RenderScene(projectJson)` independently normalises a canvas project and calls the shared
`PartPainter.Paint` and `GlowingEdges.Compute`. It accepts either a complete project or just
`scene` and `parts`. The result starts with two little-endian 32-bit integers (width, height),
followed by two tightly packed RGBA planes: scene image, then glowing edges. An unpainted canvas
returns only the eight-byte header. Image scenes fail explicitly. The browser does not need
the server experiment's PNG encoding/decoding for these local pixels.

`useScene` caches the current geometry independently of simulation results, ignoring source,
display, timeline, object name and identity edits. A dedicated scene worker computes and transfers
both planes without blocking the UI, then terminates to release its Wasm heap. Geometry changes
terminate pending workers and immediately hide obsolete scene layers. The pictures show the scene
when there is no wave frame; each layer's overlay switch and gain control the translucent glowing
edges, including over retained frames of matching dimensions.

Run `just check-wasm` to publish and exercise this export under Node. After an existing build,
`npm --prefix web run check-wasm` checks the generated bundle without publishing again, including
project submission, source edits, deterministic frames and the storage-driven frame interval.
The same check compares scene and edge pixels against native .NET output for the server commit's
scene fixture and checks geometry edits, empty canvases and independent simulation lifetimes.
It also checks point/line measurements, integrated start gates, sampling between captures and exact
probe data when seeking stored frames.
`just check-probe-graph` runs the retained graph calculation checks.

The UI edits one Project in root Preact state and opens/saves JSON text without a server.
Run sends the current project to a dedicated worker. It uses half the estimated unused origin
storage, allowing 4096 bytes of file overhead per frame, and increases the capture interval if
needed. Each field/intensity pair is written to a closed OPFS file before being announced.
The UI reads the selected frame from disc into the existing previews and timeline; it has no
RAM frame cache. Point probe histories are retained once per run as growable float32 arrays in
the page, exposing only the prefix through the selected frame. Line profiles stay on disc with their
frames. Wasm retains only the current probe batch and integration totals. The storage budget includes
the point samples and a conservative maximum size for every line profile.
Missing estimates, insufficient space and write/read errors fail explicitly.
Completion, Stop, project replacement and unmount terminate the worker and release its Wasm heap.
Edits outside display settings, colour schemes and probe graph box/axis settings cancel active work and mark retained results
outdated. Display and palette edits recolour stored samples without cancelling the worker or
invalidating its frames, including during startup. Probe measurement edits cancel the run and hide outdated recordings.
New runs, project replacement and unmount delete the previous recording. Reloads/crashes can
leave orphaned files; recovery and automatic orphan cleanup are deferred. See
[FRAME-REGENERATION.md](docs/FRAME-REGENERATION.md) for the storage calculations and deferred
checkpoint/replay design. Storage quota estimates do not guarantee physical free disc space.
The worker uses `addEventListener`, leaving `onmessage` unset to avoid .NET 10 misidentifying it
as a managed runtime thread ([dotnet/runtime#114918](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/114918)).
The runtime URL is resolved in the page before passing it to the worker, preserving deployment
prefixes. See [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the remaining migration steps.
