/// <summary>
/// The frames of one run: per frame one plane per layer (<see cref="Layers"/>) in the run's <see cref="Shape"/>:
/// <see cref="Width"/> × <see cref="Height"/> samples row-major with the engine's padding stripped, the canvas
/// shrunk by the shape's divisor, each sample a <see cref="Half"/> or a palette index byte (<see cref="Format"/>,
/// 2026-10-15; the reduced preview). Two tiers
/// (2026-10-14): the first frames of the run, as many as the memory budget given at creation holds
/// (<see cref="RamFrames"/>), live in native memory; the rest go to a temporary file that is created only when
/// a run does not fit. A run that fits never touches the disk, so it is bound by the engine and not by the
/// drive; a run that does not fit is disk-bound for its tail only. The file is pre-sized for the frames it
/// will hold, marked temporary, and deleted when the store is disposed or the process ends
/// (<see cref="FileOptions.DeleteOnClose"/>).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Why not the operating system's cache or a memory mapping: both keep dirty pages in memory only up to
/// the memory manager's own allowance and then write at disk speed whatever the file's attributes say
/// (a 10 GB full-HD run took 14 s against the drive with 40 GB of memory free), and a mapping paid a page
/// fault per fresh page and flushed everything on unmap. The budget is ours, decided from what is free when
/// the run starts (<see cref="FrameMemory.Budget(int, long)"/>), so the machine is never pushed into its page file.
/// Threads: the run's worker is the only writer (<see cref="Write(int, ReadOnlySpan{Half}, ReadOnlySpan{Half})"/>,
/// frames in order); any thread may read frames below <see cref="Count"/>, which is published after the
/// frame's bytes. Reads and writes run concurrently; <see cref="Dispose"/> waits for them, frees the memory
/// under the lock (quick) and closes the file outside it (deleting a large file can take a second).
/// A background task allocates the memory blocks a few frames ahead of the writer and touches every page of
/// them (<see cref="PrepareBlocks"/>): a fresh block costs a page fault per 4 KB on first touch, 8 to 14 ms
/// for a full-HD frame, which would make the writer slower than the engine; prepared, a frame is a plain copy.
/// File layout: a <see cref="HeaderSize"/>-byte header ("WDFS", version, width, height, layers,
/// visualize-every, capacity, first frame in the file, format, divisor, canvas width, canvas height, 1 when the
/// intensity is stored as its square root), then one
/// <see cref="FrameBytes"/> record per spilled frame; within a frame the planes follow the order of
/// <see cref="FrameLayer"/>, only those present.
