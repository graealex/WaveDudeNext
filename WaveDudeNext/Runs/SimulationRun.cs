/// <summary>
/// Drives one engine over one <see cref="RunSpec"/> on a thread-pool task: every step advances the engine and
/// samples the probes, every <see cref="RunSpec.VisualizeEvery"/>-th step is captured into a
/// <see cref="FrameSnapshot"/> and written to the <see cref="FrameStore"/> by a second task, and probe batches
/// and progress are handed to the UI at a bounded rate. The run is never paced: it goes as fast as the engine
/// and the store allow, and the preview plays from the store at its own speed.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Threads: the worker owns the engine's stepping; it captures frames (on the GPU an asynchronous read into a
/// pinned snapshot) and hands them to the writer task, which awaits the capture, writes the store and returns
/// the snapshot to a small pool, so converting and storing one frame overlaps computing the next. Every public
/// property and event is set or raised through the <see cref="SynchronizationContext"/> given to the constructor
/// (the WPF dispatcher), so they can be bound directly; with a null context they run on the worker (for
/// headless use). The <see cref="Store"/> stays the caller's to dispose, after <see cref="Completion"/> has
/// completed.
