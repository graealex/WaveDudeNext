/// Computes single frames of the current project state on demand, without a store: after an edit the
/// preview asks for "frame k of the project as it is now", and the runner steps an engine from zero to that
/// frame and captures it, sampling the project's probes along the way so their graphs are as live as the
/// picture (2026-10-14; the sampling costs a kernel launch per step and a few kilobytes of readback, nothing
/// against the stepping). The engine is kept between requests (a GPU engine takes a few hundred
/// milliseconds to build) and only reset, or given new emitters when just the sources changed; it is rebuilt
/// when the scene or the solver options change. Only the newest request is served: a request arriving
/// while one is computing abandons it. Every request is computed, however long it takes (2026-10-16, the user's
/// rule; a budget that skipped frames predicted to take over six seconds, and a version that abandoned them while
/// stepping, were both removed the same day: the note "not computed, would take too long" appeared on frames that
/// would not have, and nobody had asked for it).

/// <see cref="Completed"/> is raised through the <see cref="SynchronizationContext"/> given to the constructor
