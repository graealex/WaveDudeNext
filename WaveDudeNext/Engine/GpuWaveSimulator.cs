/// OpenCL implementation of <see cref="IWaveEngine"/>: the 2D wave equation on the graphics card, the same
/// algorithm as <see cref="WaveSimulator"/> (padded grid with a border of one cell, 9-point or sub-stepped
/// 4th-order Laplacian, soft source blending, two-stage intensity average), with the field, the scene maps,
/// the source tables and the probe buffers all resident on the device. Units are those of the CPU engine
/// (dx = dt = 1, c in cells per step, frequencies in radians per step, time in steps):
/// <code>
///   new u = u + (u - previous u) * d + laplacian * c^2     (3x3 kernel 0.066 / 0.184 / -1)
///   sources: u = u * 0.9 + sin(frequency * t) * amplitude * 0.1
///   intensity: two cascaded one-pole filters, I1 = I1 * alpha + u^2 * (1 - alpha), I2 = I2 * alpha + I1 * (1 - alpha),
///   blended (IntensityBlend) into what is shown/exported: Iout = (I1 * (1 - blend) + I2 * blend) * scale
/// </code>
/// alpha is derived once per simulation - see the <see cref="WaveSimulator"/> class summary (why two stages
/// and the blend, not a single, fixed-0.98 filter) and <see cref="Simulation.TimeDecay"/> (why
/// alpha); scale is <see cref="Simulation.IntensityScale"/> (why it exists). The field, the previous
/// field, c², d and the intensity stay in the memory of the graphics card; only when a frame is drawn
/// (<see cref="PrepareFrame"/>) the field and/or intensity are copied back. The arrays have the same layout as
/// those of the CPU engine, so the same renderer draws both.
/// Created through <see cref="TryCreate"/> by <see cref="WaveEngineFactory"/> and driven by the run on
/// its worker, which is the only thread that enqueues work and reads <see cref="FieldData"/> /
/// <see cref="IntensityData"/>. Any single thread may drive the engine; it is not safe for concurrent use.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Optionally (<c>use4thOrderLaplacian</c>), the <c>wave_step</c> kernel instead computes the Laplacian with a
/// 4th order accurate, 5-point "cross" stencil wherever there is room for it, the same as
/// <see cref="WaveSimulator"/>'s <c>UpdateField</c> on the CPU (see that class's summary for why). Which form to
/// use is baked into the generated kernel source as a compile-time <c>#define</c>, not a runtime branch, so
/// there is no extra cost when it is off.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The 4th order stencil needs the same time sub-stepping as the CPU engine to stay stable, for the same
/// reason (see <see cref="WaveSimulator"/>'s class summary): <see cref="AdvanceOneStep"/> launches
/// <c>wave_step</c> <see cref="_subSteps"/> times instead of once when <see cref="_subSteps"/> &gt; 1, with c²
/// scaled by a <c>c2Scale</c> kernel argument (1 / <see cref="_subSteps"/>²) and the d buffer pre-scaled (on
/// the host, once, at <see cref="Build"/> time) to its 1 / <see cref="_subSteps"/>-th root, so
/// <see cref="_subSteps"/> kernel launches move the field by exactly the same physical time and damping as
/// one ordinary launch. The intensity buffer is only updated (via the kernel's <c>track</c> argument) on the
/// last of the <see cref="_subSteps"/> launches, so its own exponential averaging still runs once per
/// <see cref="AdvanceOneStep"/> call, matching the CPU engine and its own earlier calibration.
/// <see cref="_subSteps"/> is 1 (<c>c2Scale</c> exactly 1.0f, an exact no-op multiply, and the d buffer
/// unchanged) whenever the 3x3 kernel is used or this scene's highest c² does not need sub-stepping - see
/// <see cref="WaveSimulator.ComputeSubSteps"/>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The field lives in two ping-pong buffers (<see cref="_field"/>) that take turns as "current field" and
/// "previous field"; every kernel that reads the field exists twice (index 0/1) with the buffers bound in
/// opposite order, so a step merely picks the kernel for <see cref="_current"/> instead of re-binding
/// arguments. Kernel launches are asynchronous; uploads and read-backs are blocking. Every OpenCL handle
/// created here is registered in <see cref="_scene"/> (the simulation program, kernels and buffers) or
/// <see cref="_probes"/> (everything <see cref="SetProbes"/> creates) and released by <see cref="Dispose"/>,
/// by the constructor when building fails, or — for the probe set — when probes are installed again. The
/// managed arrays (<see cref="FieldData"/>, <see cref="IntensityData"/>) are plain host copies.
