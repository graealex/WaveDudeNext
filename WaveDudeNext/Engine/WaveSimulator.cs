/// <summary>
/// CPU implementation of <see cref="IWaveEngine"/>: an explicit leapfrog finite-difference solver for the
/// scalar 2D wave equation on a grid padded by one cell on each side, a port of the Python class
/// WaveSimulator2D (which runs on the GPU with CuPy). Created by
/// <see cref="WaveEngineFactory"/> on the run's worker, which is the only thread that advances it and reads
/// <see cref="FieldData"/> / <see cref="IntensityData"/>. The engine has no thread affinity of its own: any
/// single thread may drive it.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Units: grid spacing and time step are both 1, so the wave speed c is in cells (canvas pixels) per step,
/// the per-cell <c>c2</c> is c² = 1/n² for refractive index n, and <see cref="Time"/> counts steps. Source
/// frequencies are angular frequencies in radians per step (<see cref="_levelFrequency"/>).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The scheme: laplacian = 3x3 convolution with [[0.066, 0.184, 0.066], [0.184, -1, 0.184], [0.066, 0.184, 0.066]],
/// new u = u + (u - previous u) * d + laplacian * c², with the field outside the domain fixed at 0. The sources
/// are applied before each step as in update_scene / StaticImageScene.update_field:
/// u = u * 0.9 + sin(frequency * t) * 0.1 (<see cref="ApplySources"/>). The field is then advanced by
/// <see cref="_subSteps"/> leapfrog sub-steps (<see cref="UpdateField"/>), the last of which also updates the
/// running intensity. The arrays have a border of one cell (which always stays 0) so that the step needs no edge
/// tests. The rows are divided over all processor cores.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The intensity is no longer a single exponential average of WaveVisualizer.update (I = I * 0.98 + u² * 0.02):
/// a single-pole filter like that only rolls off at 6 dB/octave, so it never fully removes the ripple at the
/// source's own oscillation frequency, just delays it - lengthening its time constant mostly adds trail without
/// buying much extra ripple suppression. Instead the same one-pole filter (I = I * alpha + x * (1 - alpha)) is run
/// twice in a row (<see cref="_intensityStage1"/>, then <see cref="_intensity"/>), a critically-damped 2-pole
/// low-pass that rolls off at 12 dB/octave, so for the same responsiveness it suppresses the ripple far more
/// without needing to know the local frequency at every pixel. Two full stages turned out to add more delay than
/// wanted at low frequencies (a short pulse can come and go before the second stage has caught up, understating
/// its peak) for not that much extra benefit over one, so what is actually shown/exported
/// (<see cref="_intensityOut"/>) is a blend of the one-stage and two-stage outputs (<see cref="IntensityBlend"/>) -
/// roughly the middle ground between the two (about 9, not 6 or 12, dB/octave), still well ahead of a single
/// stage at rejecting the ripple but reacting closer to as fast. alpha (<see cref="_intensityAlpha"/>) is derived
/// once per simulation so the time constant of each stage scales inversely with the frequency of the slowest
/// active source, times the user's <see cref="Simulation.TimeDecay"/> - see that property's doc
/// for why.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Optionally (<see cref="Simulation.FourthOrderLaplacian"/>), the Laplacian is instead computed with a
/// 4th order accurate, 5-point "cross" stencil (reaching 2 cells away along x and along y) wherever there is
/// room for it - see <see cref="UpdateField"/>. This reduces numerical dispersion (short, under-resolved
/// wavelengths otherwise travel slower than long ones - see the <see cref="Simulation.WaveSpeed"/> doc)
/// at roughly twice the memory reads per step. The outermost ring of the domain still uses the original 3x3
/// kernel, since it only has the usual one cell of border to read from, not the two the wider stencil needs.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The 4th order stencil's coefficients (-1/12, 4/3, -5) reach much further from zero than the 3x3 kernel's
/// (0.066, 0.184, -1) - about 7 times further at the highest spatial frequency the grid can represent - so the
/// same c² that is safely stable with the 3x3 kernel can be wildly unstable with the 4th order one (the field
/// blows up: everywhere saturates except at object edges, which is what an invalid/unstable Laplacian looks
/// like). To stay stable without changing the physical wave speed, <see cref="AdvanceOneStep"/> instead takes
/// <see cref="_subSteps"/> smaller time steps per call when the 4th order stencil is used: c² is scaled by
/// 1 / _subSteps² (matching a time step _subSteps times smaller) and the damping factor d by its _subSteps-th
/// root (so _subSteps applications of it compound back to the original d), so the net effect after _subSteps
/// steps is exactly the same physical propagation and damping as one ordinary step - just spread over more,
/// individually stable, time steps. _subSteps is computed once per scene from its highest c²
/// (<see cref="ComputeSubSteps"/>) and is 1 (no sub-stepping, and a multiply by the exact literal 1.0F)
/// whenever the 3x3 kernel is used or the scene's c² does not need it.
