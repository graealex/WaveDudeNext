# WaveDude Next — project notes for Claude

Last updated 2026-10-23. The long history is in git (`git show a6f85dc:CLAUDE.md`). Keep this file short.

## What this is

A 2D wave-equation simulator (field and intensity views, scenes from images, point and composite sources, probes
with live graphs, video export): a .NET 10 library (`WaveDudeNext/`) plus a WPF app (`WaveDudeNext.WPF/`), the
successor of Jeroen Vleggaar's (Huygens Optics) **Wave Dude 2D**, GPL-3.0-or-later, by Alexander Graef. Jeroen's
VB source and the C# port of his binary live in git history up to `d3ac0d8`; read his VB there when his intent
matters. The harnesses are `_tools/library_check` (console, not in the `.sln`) and `_tools/ui_check` (PowerShell).
The user works in Visual Studio with Claude Code in the chat, permissions skipped, often at the machine while
harnesses run.

## How to work here (the user's rules)

- **Git only on his word for the change at hand.** "Commit" in his latest message means commit now; otherwise
  report the work as uncommitted. Never commit, push, reset, amend, stash, checkout, rebase or merge on your own.
  Enforced by `.claude/hooks/git-guard.py` (needs Python on the PATH, else every shell command is blocked); a shell
  command whose text merely mentions git plus such a word is denied too. End commit messages with
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- **No design changes on your own.** Anything beyond a mechanical change goes to him as options with pros and
  cons, complete, with links when naming a project, then built as chosen. Never invent a feature nobody asked for
  (the scratch budget that skipped "too expensive" frames was one; torn out). Bugs you find: fix and prove.
- **Verification matches the change**: a clean build (0 warnings; `///` docs and the header are enforced) plus one
  targeted probe or screenshot for a local change, `library_check` (20 s) for a library change, a UI harness only
  when its flow changed, **once**. Never loop a harness for a flake, never run the suite after an edit.
- **Measure properly**: warm the JIT; never poll UI Automation while measuring (it loads the UI thread it
  measures); the app's own log lines are the measurement.
- **Harnesses are keyboard-only**: post `WM_KEYDOWN`/`WM_CHAR` to the window, read state through UIA properties,
  never UIA patterns, the mouse, `SendKeys` or `SetForegroundWindow` (each activates the window). Modifiers cannot
  be posted, so every command a harness presses has an unmodified key. Everything a harness needs has an
  `AutomationId`. Keep a failing run's output; a filtered run cannot be read afterwards.
- **Keyboard first in the app**: every control reachable with Tab and the arrows, focus visible; a mouse-only
  control is a bug. The menu bar is out of the Tab cycle (F10).
- **Commands writing outside the repo** hit the sandbox prompt: set `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` up front.
- **No scratch files in the repo tree** (2026-10-19, after screenshots and probe scripts were left behind for the user to
  clean up): edit scripts, one-off probes, test projects and screenshots live under `%TEMP%\WaveDudeNext` (create it,
  `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`), are named once with their full path when the user should look, and are deleted by the
  session that made them; a harness project file beside `Common.ps1` is deleted in the script's `finally`.
- **He writes his own prose** (README, mails): offer verified facts and screenshots; never "I" sentences for him,
  never claims about him he has not made.
- **Spelling**: British in the UI, except **"license"** everywhere (the GPL's own word). No talk of BOMs or line
  endings.
- **Dependencies**: no package named after a person, no AGPL/GPL libraries, flag vibe-coded candidates; in-house
  preferred (docking, encoders, colour picker are in-house). Microsoft packages are fine.
- **WPF idioms**: commands not `_Click`, bindings not hand-pushed state, `DynamicResource` for every theme brush and
  string, `XmlSerializer` with sparse XML (attributes, repeated children, `[DefaultValue]`), Segoe UI 9 pt, the
  dnSpy look (its sources are GPL: look, do not copy). Inside a `DataTemplate` reference the string keys directly
  (`{DynamicResource Hint.Type.Member}`): the `meta:Label`/`meta:Hint` extensions wrap a resource reference a template
  rejects for a string property and shows as text for an object one (2026-10-22, found on the fibre's node rows). An
  The XAML designer never runs a window's constructor: what the preview must show lives in XAML, as the dock host's
  default arrangement does (`DockHost.DefaultLayout` in `MainWindow.xaml`, the one source for the first start and the
  designer, which then shows every hidden pane at its default side, Messages at the bottom, 2026-10-26; nested types
  cannot be XML names, so the layout nodes are top-level classes). An
  implicit style never reaches a class derived from `Window`, so every window names the theme's
  (`Style="{StaticResource {x:Type Window}}"`, 2026-10-23: without its layout rounding the pictures sat at fractional
  pixels and WPF resampled them; its Display text formatting had never applied either).
- **Model conventions**: a new property gets its XML attribute with a default, `[Category]`/`[DisplayName]`/
  `[Description]`, a `///` summary, a clamp in `Normalize()` with the matching `[Range]` beside the default (2026-10-21:
  the bounds are readable from outside, `library_check` proves each against `Normalize()`; a bound that depends on another
  value stays in code alone and is named in its `dependentBounds`; since 2026-10-22 it finds every part kind itself and
  fails a persisted number that `Normalize()` clamps without a `[Range]`), and `Label.`/`Hint.`/`Enum.<Type>.<Member>` keys in all four string tables. Randomness from
  `Project.Seed` through `Pcg32`; generated data is never persisted.
- **C# style**: modern and concise, expression-bodied accessors, no `this.`, no `IDisposable` on interfaces,
  `out` not `ref`, tabs, Allman; `///` docs state threading, units and coordinate systems. `grep -E`, not `-P`.
- **Log decisions at Debug** (scratch requests, stale marks, postponed re-runs, export steps). Info and up reach
  the status bar; Trace only in Debug builds. Log messages are not localised, and their numbers are invariant (NLog's
  DefaultCultureInfo, 2026-10-27, the user's rule: a report's reader or tool must not trip over a decimal comma). **The log must let a report be
  diagnosed** (2026-10-27, the user's rule after Jeroen's log named the property edited but not the value, nor the
  grid): every engine logs its grid, canvas, rim, edges, stride, sub-steps and work groups when built; a GPU device's
  facts (versions, units, clock, memory, limits) once per process; the scratch request names the newest edit with its
  value (after the debounce, so a typed number shows as typed); every change at Trace as old → new
  (`PropertyValueChangedEventArgs` from `SetProperty`, carried by `ProjectChange.Values`, `library_check` proves it).
- **Do not resurrect**: a probe signal lane, timeline tracks, zoom and pan of the axis, thumbnails, a run progress
  bar, the scratch budget and its "not computed" note, a GPU JPEG front end, a Direct3D display path, a bent
  rotation lever. **Do not change**: the readout showing both frame and step (undecided).
- Collect the reusable rules for other projects only when he asks.

## Build and run

- `dotnet build WaveDudeNext.sln` → 0 warnings. Harnesses use `WaveDudeNext.WPF\bin\Debug\net10.0-windows\WaveDudeNext.WPF.exe`.
- `dotnet run --project _tools/library_check -c Release` (`-- export`, `-- bench [w h]`, `-- bench-render [w h]`,
  `-- bench-export [w h]`); `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File _tools/ui_check/<script>.ps1` (`-Trace`).
- Publish: `dotnet publish WaveDudeNext.WPF/WaveDudeNext.WPF.csproj -p:PublishProfile=SingleFile`. Version in
  `Directory.Build.props`; the commit hash lands in About. The license header is the `.editorconfig`
  `file_header_template` (its warranty sentence ends in a full stop: Roslyn cuts the value at `;`). LICENSE.md is
  the FSF's GPL-3.0 Markdown verbatim, nothing else (GitHub's detector rejects additions); the About dialog shows
  it as a document built by `Build/LicenseDocument.targets`.
- The library is compiled optimised in every configuration (flip it locally to step through engine code). The user
  settings are one sparse XML file, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WaveDudeNext\Settings.xml` (`Settings.cs`, `XmlSerializer`, 2026-10-26, the
  user's choice: .NET's `ApplicationSettingsBase` kept a `user.config` per exe path and version under a folder named after
  the assembly's company, his name by default; Authors and Company are now the product's name, nothing personal in folder
  names). Folders under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Alexander_Graef` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WaveDudeNext.WPF` are leftovers of that. Close Visual Studio before renaming a
  project folder.

## Architecture

```
Project (Model/) --RunSpec.Create--> RunSpec (immutable snapshot); the scene pixels come from MainWindow.Live's
   LoadSceneImage: the decoded image (or a blank canvas) with the enabled optical parts painted into red by
   PartPainter (Parts/), cached by (image, parts version, size, background) so an unchanged scene is the same reference
StartRun: memory budget -> DiscardRun (returns the old store's release task) -> FrameStore -> SimulationRun
SimulationRun: stepping loop + writer threads; IWaveEngine (WaveSimulator CPU | GpuWaveSimulator OpenCL);
   CaptureFrame/AwaitFrame -> FrameStore.Write; one heartbeat post (<= 30/s) at Background priority; final post sets
   FrameCount, then State
ScratchRunner: one kept engine; "frame k of the project as it is now" from step 0, probes sampled; newest request
   wins; every request is computed
FramePresenter: CopyLayer -> 8-bit: FrameRenderer.RenderIndexed at the store's size, WPF scales; 16-bit: ScreenRenderer at
   the picture's size on screen -> the WriteableBitmap, copied on the pool between Lock/Unlock on the UI thread; only
   the newest request is rendered
ExportJob (own STA thread): CopyLayer -> FrameRenderer -> outline -> probe boxes/markers -> sinks (PNG, JPEG, MPEG-1, AVI, MP4, MOV)
FrameStore: native memory up to the budget, the rest in a temp file (%LOCALAPPDATA%\WaveDudeNext\cache, DeleteOnClose)
```

- **Engine contract**: padded grid (`Stride = Width + 2 + 2 × Rim`: a negative damping edge is a rim of that many cells
  outside the canvas, simulated and never shown, the canvas starting at (Rim, Rim); `Scene.Edges` Open puts Mur's
  first-order absorbing condition on the ring, Reflective is Jeroen's wall; a new project is Open with a 32 px rim outside
  (2026-10-22, the user's choice, after the rim measurements below; no damping edge from 2026-10-19 until then, when the
  open ring was measured on a long-wave pulse: the open ring alone returns 0.05 to 0.09 % of the
  amplitude, a rim at its best the same, a rim damped to a standstill 1 %, the reflective box 72 %). The rim's loss rises
  with the square of the depth to a half per step at the outer ring (2026-10-22, the user's choice: at wavelengths of a few
  cells, Jeroen's usual, the ring's Mur condition assumes a speed the stencil does not have and reflects almost
  everything, so the rim absorbs alone; measured against a reference canvas too wide to reflect, Example 3's beam got
  1 % back from the earlier linear ramp to a tenth at -64, 0.09 % from the quadratic one, 0.03 % at -128; the measuring
  method is in `library_check`); a version-1 file loads as
  Reflective, a version-2 file without a damping edge with none (its default then; files are version 3 since 2026-10-22), an
  import as Reflective with his band; one driver thread at a time, no locking; the kernels over the grid and the captures run in explicit 32 × 8 work groups over a global size rounded up to whole groups (2026-10-27, Jeroen's report: left to the driver, the group had to divide the grid, and a prime width, 1789 for a 1725 px canvas with the rim, got groups one cell wide, 13–19× slower on the RTX 2080; every candidate shape from 16 × 16 to 256 × 1 measured the same); captures
  deliver planes in the spec's `FrameShape` (halves or palette index bytes, the GPU converting on the card);
  `Reset`, `SetEmitters`, `SetProbes`. Numerics are Jeroen's (dx = dt = 1, leapfrog, 9-point or 4th-order
  Laplacian, soft sources, EMA intensity; a scene pixel with red 0 is a mirror, n = 1000, his V0.30 rule,
  2026-10-18), verified CPU = GPU by the harness; seeds from `Pcg32` make CPU = GPU
  bit for bit on random gaps. A source's frequency level, amplitude and phase take decimals (2026-10-19, Jeroen's point 10); the
  level is capped at 255, above which the grid cannot sample the wave; object sources carry their frequency as a float on
  the GPU, the 256-entry table serves the image sources. The importer's fallbacks differ from the model's defaults on purpose.
- **Frames vs steps**: frame k is the state after step `k × VisualizeEvery`.
- **The engine choice is a user setting** (Simulation > Use the GPU, default on, CPU fallback logged).
- **Frame store**: budget = the lesser of free physical memory and available commit (2026-10-19: Windows refuses an
  allocation at the commit limit first, and a run that filled the physical measure left no room for the preview's
  bitmap, which took the app down; a failed bitmap is now logged and the picture stays empty) minus 2 GB, capped by
  Simulation > RAM cache size (Auto or a share); the
  outgoing run's frames count as reclaimed and the new store waits for their release. No memory mapping, no OS
  cache reliance (both wrote at disk speed). Disposed on the thread pool. Full HD, 2500 steps, both planes: 10.4 GB
  in 16-bit, half in 8-bit.
- **Reduced preview** (View menu): resolution 1/2/4, frames 1/2/4 (the timeline never changes), samples 16-bit or
  **8-bit palette index, the default**: the stored samples at the palette's 255 colours and the captured brightness,
  half the store; 16-bit keeps the brightness turnable after a run and shows every level of the gradient. In 8-bit a
  brightness edit is a simulation edit. **A 16-bit intensity plane holds √I** (2026-10-23, the user's choice: the
  renderer colours √I, and as I the dark end lay among half's subnormals, below 6.1e-5, up to a palette level between
  neighbours; as √I the floor is at I = 3.7e-9, the brightest parts a bit coarser): `FrameShape.IntensityRoot`, from the
  run's `PreviewQuality`, produced by `FrameConversion` and `capture_half`, reported by every `IFrameSource` through its
  `Shape`; the renderer, the screen path (which blends it as energy) and the fit go by its `SampleKind`. **The 8-bit
  index is the palette index of the half a 16-bit frame would store** (the field, √I), computed on the CPU and in the
  kernel (a bit-level rounding there, the GPU program built with a correctly rounded square root where the card has one),
  so CPU and GPU store the same bytes (2026-10-19) and both previews start from one value (2026-10-23, the user's choice:
  rounding I to a half first had merged the darkest indices at a high brightness, 2e-8 at 30 coming out 0 instead of 1).
  Every export needs the 16-bit samples (2026-10-23, the user's choice, so a picture has every level of the gradient):
  an 8-bit run, a reduced resolution or skipped frames make the export run the simulation again at full quality first.
  Only an OpenEXR export of I makes a run that stores I itself (squaring √I back would lose a bit); as coded, that run is
  then the one the preview shows until the next edit or run (undecided whether it should be a side run).

## The app's rules

- **Live editing**: a simulation edit (scene, solver, seed, sources) marks the run stale, **stops playback and any
  active run**, requests a scratch frame for the position (120 ms debounce) and re-runs automatically after 1.5 s
  of quiet (setting, default on); an automatic run never moves the preview. A probe edit never starts a run: only
  the recordings are stale, the scratch frame refreshes the graph; except that an active probe the run does not
  record (switched on, added) is a simulation edit (2026-10-18). No scratch frame while playback runs. Any run
  is paused while a scratch frame computes. Every scratch request is computed, however long.
- **A picture changes only when a frame for its position arrives**; otherwise the last picture stays. A long wait
  dims the pictures under a spinner, mirrored on the taskbar.
- **Brightness** (2026-10-20, Jeroen's point 9) sits in each picture's header strip (`HeaderStrip`: title, a caption that
  gives way first, the box and **Auto** at the far end; turned on its side with the title); Auto fits once to the frame
  shown (the 99.5th percentile of |field| or √intensity at the palette's top, the user's choice of the variants), an
  8-bit preview computing that frame in 16-bit first; the context menu has Brightness and Auto brightness. The box
  steps by a factor (`NumberBox.Logarithmic`, 2026-10-26): two percent a key, a fifth a page, three significant digits.
- **Edge line** (2026-10-25, the user's choice): a 1 px line around each preview picture in the colour of what a wave
  meets at the canvas edge: pure red for a reflective wall (the index's channel), pure blue for a damping rim outside
  the canvas (the absorbers' channel; `Scene.HasRim`; a rim wins over a wall), nothing for open edges or a damping band
  inside the canvas; the scene's colours, not the theme's; preview only. For it the picture's cell is sized to the
  picture (the overlays measure to the uniform fit and remeasure on a canvas change) while `PictureFrame` fills its
  cell, so the heading stays at the top.
- **Play means "show me the simulation"**: it starts an automatic run when needed and holds at the newest frame
  until the run catches up. Live follows a running run until the user scrubs; it ends with a last follow to the
  final frame. A replaced project goes to frame 0; a discarded run keeps the position. In/out points are steps.
- **A new source, probe or part lands at the centre of the canvas the preview shows** (2026-10-26, Jeroen's report: one
  at the corner went unnoticed inside the rim); the model's parameterless adders take the scene's size, the window passes
  the shown canvas's centre, which an image scene sizes; a new probe's line end lies 100 px to the right.
- **Handles and overlays**: sources, probes, emitter dots and the rotation handle are drawn over the pictures in
  canvas pixels, over a dark halo, clipped to the picture, in a light grey, the selected item's in a bright yellow
  (`PictureHandle`, `PictureSelection` in `Controls.xaml`, 2026-10-26, Jeroen's tester: the accent blue was duller than
  the rest and lost on a blue scheme and to colour-blind eyes; the keyboard focus keeps the accent); a probe's handles and line appear only on the picture of
  the layer it measures (2026-10-18), sources on both; graph boxes lie over every handle and dot, the selected
  item is drawn last among its kind, except the handles themselves (Panel.ZIndex breaks the Tab cycle, 2026-10-18);
  arrows nudge, Del on a handle or a graph box removes its item or the selection it belongs to as the tree's Del does
  (2026-10-26), selection syncs with the tree, a click on empty space deselects. **Group selection** (2026-10-19): one shared `SelectedItems` list on the window beside the
  current `SelectedItem` (the properties pane shows the current one); in the tree Ctrl+click, Insert or Ctrl+Space
  toggles a row, Shift+click or Shift+arrows selects the range from the anchor, Ctrl+A everything, the row's context
  menu has both; on the pictures a drag on empty space is a marquee (Shift adds, Ctrl toggles), Ctrl+click on a handle
  toggles, Shift+click adds; a drag of the handle of one of several selected items, or the arrows on it, moves them all
  through `IMovable` with the delta limited so none leaves the canvas (the formation holds); Escape during a drag puts
  things back; Remove, Duplicate and Enabled act on the whole selection when their target is in it; the lever, grips
  and point handles belong to the current item alone. Probe graph boxes follow their probe while attached, resize by a grip, keep their text
  size; an amplitude axis is symmetric about zero; an intensity graph's value axis can be logarithmic (2026-10-20,
  Jeroen's point 8: `Decades` below the fitted top, zeros on the bottom line, powers-of-ten ticks; the field stays linear).
- **Undo and redo** (2026-10-22, the user's request, unlimited): `ProjectHistory` keeps one snapshot per step, the
  project file's XML without the scene image plus the image's bytes by reference (equal bytes shared). A step ends after
  0.5 s of quiet with no mouse button held (`MainWindow.History`); Undo and Redo (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y, Ctrl+Shift+Z; a text
  box keeps its own) write the step back into the same project object, the lists refilled and the settings objects
  replaced, so the watcher reports it as an edit (stale run, scratch frame, re-run) and nothing is recorded; the
  selection follows by name, then by index; the title's asterisk clears at the saved step. The Edit menu (between File
  and View) holds Undo, Redo, Cut, Copy, Paste and Delete; the UI harnesses step over it.
- **Copy, cut, paste, drag and drop** (2026-10-23, the user's choices): `ProjectClipboard` writes sources, parts,
  probes and schemes (the `INamed` items) and the Scene, Simulation and Display objects as a fragment of their own file
  elements, in the app's format and as plain text (read back from text too, so a text editor takes and gives the XML).
  Paste goes behind the current item, before it for a drop on a row's upper half, renames only on a clash, emitters
  from the target's seed; a settings object replaces only on its own row or the project root. A tree drag carries the
  same text and nothing else; the target decides (2026-10-23, the user's choice, replacing a live item in the drag data
  and a refusal of the own drag by the pictures): the own tree reorders the item it keeps in a field, another window's
  tree pastes, and a picture of this window or another pastes and moves the objects as a group onto the drop pixel
  (`PlaceAt`, held inside the canvas), so a drag from the tree to the picture duplicates. `ObjectsData` reads a drag or
  the clipboard and parses each text once; the window reads the clipboard once per change of Windows' clipboard
  sequence number. The tree and the pictures claim a drag only when they take it; a file dropped anywhere is the window's,
  which opens it (2026-10-26, Jeroen's report: for three days a file over the tree or a picture was refused).
- **Icons** (2026-10-22/23): a menu entry gets one through the attached `MenuIcon.Glyph` (a code point of Segoe Fluent
  Icons that Segoe MDL2 Assets has too, for Windows 10; the `IconGlyphText` style, greyscale) or `MenuIcon.Drawing`, the
  name of an `Icon<Name>` (and `Icon<Name>Fill`) `StreamGeometry` in `Themes/Controls.xaml`; both make an `IconView`,
  which the tree's rows and toolbar use directly (`PlusBadge` on the add buttons) and which draws in the inherited text
  colour, so a disabled row's icon greys with its name through one trigger on the row. A lens row's icon is its own
  profile (2026-10-29, the user's design): nine `IconLens<Left><Right>` drawings, each surface convex, flat or concave by
  its radius's sign, chosen by `LensIconConverter` from R1 and R2 in a template scoped to the row's icon, so it follows an
  edit; the Part menu's `IconLens` is the biconvex one. The Mirror box renames the part, Lens to Mirror and back
  (`LensPart.MirrorName`, run by the box's command and never by the setter, so a loaded or undone name stays). Drawings are 16 px, 1 px strokes
  on half pixels, ink in rows and columns 0 to 14 (odd, so it centres like text); every tree row, toolbar button and
  menu entry is 23 px, the menu bar's headers through their padding. The pictures' handle glyphs stay in
  `PreviewPane.xaml`, odd-sized (21, 15, 13 px) with the point at the centre pixel (2026-10-26, Jeroen's report: at 20 px the
  window's layout rounding put the dot, its halo and the crosshair half a pixel apart).
- **Colour schemes are gradients** (2026-10-23, the user's design): the model holds the stops and no table; how many
  colours are taken is the renderer's (`ColorLut`): 255 at i/254 for 8-bit frames (the author's table, truncated as in
  his Python), and for 16-bit frames a table of the 65,536 half values per layer and brightness, the gradient at each
  value's position, rounded (the 255 entries had left visible patches two to five levels apart in dark gradients).
- **Two preview paths** (2026-10-23, the user's design): 8-bit samples are the fast preview, coloured at the store's
  size and scaled by WPF, as before. 16-bit samples are drawn at each picture's size on screen (`ScreenRenderer`, the
  pane reports the Image's rounded `RenderSize` in device pixels): resampled in value space, never colours (a box mean
  when shrinking, bilinear when enlarging, so every pixel shows a real value in a gradient colour), then the half
  table. The pictures are `CanvasImage`s, sized by the canvas and never by their bitmap, so a 16-bit bitmap is plain
  screen pixels drawn 1:1 and a new one never moves the layout (2026-10-23: a resolution set to make the bitmap measure
  the canvas came back from WPF in single precision, the reuse test failed on every frame, and the pane flickered).
  **Preview dithering** (View menu, user setting, off by default until the user has seen it; only with 16-bit samples):
  the colours at 16 bits per channel (`DeepHalfTable`) to 8 through a Bayer matrix of 2, 4, 8 or 16 cells a side for
  10, 12, 14 or 16 bits, fixed to the picture's pixels (on the screen's, by the window's layout rounding); preview only, never in an export (a video crushes it; an export
  above 8 bits per channel is a possible future goal). A better algorithm than Bayer may come later.
- **Colour schemes** are stop lists in `.wdscheme` XML, shipped ones embedded, user ones in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WaveDudeNext\ColorSchemes`, project ones in the `.wdproj`; an in-house picker edits stops;
  renaming a project scheme repoints its layers. **The scene image** is embedded and follows its file on disk, the
  path being where it came from (2026-10-26, Jeroen's report: the scene form shows the image rows for an image scene
  only, says "(not found)" beside a path whose file is gone, which changes nothing, and has three buttons beside the name,
  2026-10-29, the user's design: "…" picks a file, a save glyph writes the embedded bytes to a file, an export that
  changes nothing in the project, and the X drops the name, the path and the bytes and leaves a blank canvas of the
  image's size);
  the "glowing edges" outline overlays the pictures. **Import** of Jeroen's `configuration.json` is key for key; a source whose position was
  never picked (`has_position` false) stays enabled at its x/y, since his program simulated it there (Example 11's
  lattice came in disabled and ran black until 2026-10-16).
  **Languages**: four string tables, live switch; converter output needs the language as an extra binding input.
- **Export**: field, intensity or both, a still of the shown frame, from the current run when fresh and full,
  else a run is made first. **The Save dialog starts where the session's last export of its kind went** (2026-10-28,
  Jeroen's report, the user's rule: the first export after a project is opened starts in the project's folder under the
  project's name as before, every one after it in the last one's folder; a run's export proposes the last name with the
  layer suffix swapped, a still and probe data their own names; per kind and per project file, kept in the user settings
  as `ExportHint` entries, 20 projects, restored when the project is opened, the user's choice over the project file: a
  path belongs to the machine, not to a shared file, and an export must not dirty the project).
  **Export last** (Ctrl+E, File menu below Export, 2026-10-28, the user's request): the session's last run export again,
  the same layers, format and path, no dialog, an existing file or sequence folder replaced without a question; a still
  does not count; disabled until the first run export since the project was opened. Shortcuts (the user's choice, GIMP's
  pair): Ctrl+Shift+E, I, B the field, the intensity, both; Ctrl+Shift+F, G the two frames. In the dialog's order (2026-10-19) H.264 MP4 via Media Foundation (the only
  Windows-bound library piece besides WIC JPEG, which has an in-house fallback), MPEG-1, OpenDML AVI, QuickTime
  MOV with the Animation codec or the PNG codec (2026-10-19, each sample a PNG, for a lossless hand-over to Resolve,
  Premiere and Final Cut; both share `.mov`, so the dialog's filter decides the format and the extension follows it,
  while a scripted path goes by its extension, `.mov` meaning Animation), PNG/JPEG sequences (the files numbered by timeline frame, a range export from its first
  frame, and a still padded the same way, `name_0655.png`; never a step number, 2026-10-19), and
  **probe data as CSV** (2026-10-18: a probe's context menu in the tree and on its graph box; semicolons, decimal
  point, a header row; a point probe one row per step, a line probe one row per frame; the full run like the
  pictures, started first when needed),
  **JPEG is 4:4:4 in both encoders** (2026-10-18: WIC called natively for its subsampling option, which WPF's
  wrapper never set; 4:2:0 averaged the colour, where a wave picture's information is, into blocky fringes even
  at quality 100; 4:4:4 at 90 beat it in every channel at half the size), and
  **OpenEXR sequences or stills** (2026-10-18, the user's choice for data export to NumPy, MATLAB, Octave add-ons
  and viewers such as DJV): the stored halves themselves, one uncompressed "Y" channel per file, no colours,
  brightness, outline or boxes; a sink that `WantsHalves` gets the plane from the job unrendered. Two entries in the
  dialog (2026-10-23): the intensity as I (a run storing I is made first; a scripted `.exr`) or as √I (the preview's
  run as it is); the field the same in both. **Source markers**
  (2026-10-21, Display, off by default, the user's choices): the preview's marker, a composite source's dots and the
  name, enabled sources only, scaled like the probe labels, under the probe markers and boxes. Harness hooks:
  `WAVEDUDE_EXPORT_PATH`, `WAVEDUDE_DISCARD_EDITS=1`.
- **Optical parts** (2026-10-18; **`OpticalParts.md` is the reference**: the kinds, the painting rules, the measurements
  and how to add a kind): subclasses of `OpticalPart` in `Project.Parts`, one class and one XML element per kind, the
  class being the kind (no enum, 2026-10-22): a lens or mirror, the shapes under `ShapePart` (polygon, rectangle, ellipse,
  triangle, outline), a fibre on a Bézier path, a Bragg reflector, a GRIN lens, the XOR, AND and OR gates under
  `LogicGatePart` and a zone plate (both Jeroen's, 2026-10-21/22). Painted into the scene pixels, red the index (red 0 a
  mirror), blue for absorbers, green never; a part edit is a simulation edit. The menus of kinds share `PartMenuEntries`
  (`ProjectTree.xaml`), added by `ProjectTree.MenuEntries`, not as an `ItemsSource`.
- File types `.wdproj` / `.wdscheme` are registered per user at start-up; unsaved edits ask on close.

## Numbers (workstation: 10-core Xeon without AVX2, RTX 2080, 64 GB)

GPU step at 1080p 0.25–0.5 ms, CPU 6–14 ms; OpenCL build 0.3 s; a full-HD run of 2500 steps 5.4 s in RAM, bound by
the GPU readback. Renderer per 2880×1080 layer on ten cores (2026-10-23, a table lookup per pixel): 16-bit 0.5 ms,
8-bit 0.6; a half table built in 0.4 ms; the screen path from 1920×1080 to 914×514 1.4 ms, dithered 1.5. Presenter for
Example 7 (2880×1080 in a 458×172 picture, both layers, playing): 16-bit 7.3–8.5 ms a frame, dithered 7.7–9.1, 8-bit
10–11 (its bitmaps are canvas-sized). Presenter about 7 ms a frame quiet, 20 during a run. JPEG 1080p at 4:4:4: WIC 26 ms a frame
single-threaded (9 ms a frame in a sequence job on half the cores), in-house 9.8 ms on ten cores (15 in a job);
MP4 job 16 ms a frame. Part painter on a Full HD canvas (ten cores): a 400 × 330 outline 30 ms, a 400 px lens 5, a hexagon 8, an S-bent fibre across the canvas 51 (156 chords on the cell grid; 1.3 s without it);
the glowing edges 22 ms; the preview's scene pictures about 100 ms more, so the scene rebuild is coalesced at background priority. Laptop (2 cores, HD 520, HDD): iGPU 4.3 ms a step against CPU 14.7; the ball
lens run 105 s full quality (disk-bound), 61 s at half resolution with every second frame, in RAM. Settled by these
numbers: no GPU JPEG, no OpenCL colouring at presentation, no `Vector256`, no Direct3D display path.

## Harnesses

`library_check` (100+ checks: engines, store, renderer, half tables, screen path, schemes, probes, scratch, reduced preview, importer, export, parts, group move, open edges, work groups on a prime grid, ranges, XOR gate, zone plate, gate port follower, history, clipboard).
UI, all on `Common.ps1`, with their check counts: `PreviewCheck` 43, `RunCheck` 71, `LanguageCheck` 11,
`ProbeGraphCheck` 39, `ImportCheck` 10, `ExportCheck` 41, `PreviewQualityCheck` 35, `SceneImageCheck` 8,
`ColorPickerCheck` 13, `KeyboardCheck` 13, `AboutCheck` 18, `SelectionCheck` 10. Test projects `tiny*.wdproj` sit beside them. A harness
sets the persisted settings it expects (split orientation, preview quality). Known flake: a second app start in one
script sometimes comes up active; only the foreground guard fails then.

## Open items

README and a documentation file (he writes them); release (single-file publish, portable archive, signed installer,
curated examples from Jeroen, his program as preserved assets, repository rename); an integer
upscale in exports; HEVC; the start-up stall (log milestones first); the GPU readback (a second OpenCL queue);
automatic quality lowering when a run would spill (undecided); dropping the 9-point Laplacian (undecided);
**optical parts**: the open points at the end of `OpticalParts.md` (a `PartCheck.ps1` harness, example projects,
the menu versus buttons, Bragg thicknesses in pixels, where examples live) wait for the user.

**Unsolved: clicks on the intensity picture selected nothing** (2026-10-22, seen once, not reproduced). In
`Wave_Dude_Examples/logical_elements_example.wdproj`, after several undo and redo cycles (gates moved, undone, redone),
a click on Probe 1's or Rectangle 1 copy's handle in the intensity picture selected nothing; nothing lay over them, the
user checked. Reopening the project (a fresh start) cured it. The session is in the Release build's log
(`WaveDudeNext.WPF\bin\Release\net10.0-windows\WaveDudeNext.WPF.log`, 21:58:52 to 22:00:42): no warning or error, and
the log records no clicks or selection changes. Looked at without a finding: `SceneOverlay` and `ProbeGraphOverlay`
rebuild their handles on every list change (an undo keeps the list objects, refills them), the selection bindings
overlay > pane > window are two-way, the marquee releases its mouse capture, the busy dimming is not hit-testable, the
graph boxes lay far from both handles. A keyboard-driven rerun (handles moved, undone, redone) found every handle once,
in place. Not yet looked at: the click path itself (`MarkerThumb` drag start, mouse capture after an undo during or
right after a drag, focus) with logging of what a press hits.
