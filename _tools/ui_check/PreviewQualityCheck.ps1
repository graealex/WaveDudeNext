# Drives View > Preview resolution / frames / samples by keyboard (F10 focuses the menu bar, Down opens a menu, Right moves
# over Edit to View, Down walks its entries, Right opens a submenu, Enter picks) on tiny.wdproj (64 x 48, 200 steps, a frame every
# 2 steps): a run is made, then each choice marks it stale and the automatic re-run follows in the reduced shape (the
# status bar, the frame readout and the log file next to the exe are the witnesses: "50 of 100 frames stored as 32x24
# (1/2 resolution, every 2. frame, 8-bit)"). The timeline never changes: with every second frame stored, frames 98 and
# 99 show the same picture while 97 differs; the source marker stays at the source's canvas position on a half-size
# picture; the settings survive a restart; everything is put back to Full at the end. Posted keys and UI Automation
# properties only, as in the other harnesses.
