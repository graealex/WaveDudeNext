1. **1. Source Mirror Probe**
   Simple omnidirectional pulsed source with a smoothed square intensity profile, reflecting of simple mirror surface. A probe measures the intensity profile near the surface.
2. **2. Coherent source gaussian beam**
   Featuring a 21 x 7 composite source that emits a continuous gaussian beam
3. **3. Directional pulsed source**
   Featuring a coherent pulsed assembly of sources that emits a directional stream of wave pulses.
4. **4. 3 sources 3 frequencies**
   Geometric wave pattern resulting from 3 sources with different frequencies
5. **5. Small incoherent source**
   Simulation features a small (5x5 composite) source using randomized "off"-time and source frequency.
6. **6. Large incoherent source**
   Featuring a large (450+ composite) source that creates both spatially- as well as temporally incoherent wave emission. The probes show that even though the intensity variations are large for an incoherent source, they eventually average out over time. Probe 2 shows the 1/r relationship. where r= distance to the source.
7. **7. Random emitter lattice**
   Collection of 800+ sources distributed over the full animation space and emitting short random wave pulses with a varying frequency.
8. **8. Resonant wave in cavity**
   Wave energy released at the center of a cavity at almost the resonance frequency.

    One source and a zone plate
12. **12. Pulse splitter**
    Short coherent pulse divided by a beam splitter
13. **13. Bragg reflector**
    Demo of a Bragg reflector. The layer thickness of each layer should be 1/4 lambda divided by the refractive index of the specific layer. However, reflectivity is strongly angle dependent.
14. **14. Resonant roundabout**
    Resonant roundabout with two sources and two exits. If you change the phase of one of the sources by 180 degrees, waves will take the other exit.
15. **15. Top up the tank**
    Filling a tank with radiative energy
16. **16. Wave in 2 boxes**
    Two boxes connected by a small pipe that allows for wave energy to flow from left to right (and back).
17. **17. Hanbury Brown Twiss**
    Switch on the small source and the two telescopes will see highly correlated signals. Switch on the large source and the correlation disappears. This is a demonstration of the area of coherence as can be measured in the HBT experiment to measure the ratio between the diameter and the distance of a star.
18. **18. XOR AND OR logic**
    3 logical wave gates chained together
19. **19. Sources with spherical mirror**
    Wave pulse emitted from the center of the curvature of a mirror, reflecting and then returning to the point of emission. Featuring timed probes. Notice that this simulation runs extremely fast on the GPU, when no video export is selected.

    The simulation shows the interference pattern created between two high-refractive index surfaces in close proximity of each other under a small angle.
21. **21. Ball lens**

- Top: single mode fiber
- Middle: narrow multi-mode fiber
- Bottom: wide multi-mode fiber
  Includes the use of two probes, an A-B (line) field probe and a single point intensity probe.
24. **24. Fiber cross over**
    Two single-mode fibres side by side, their cores a dozen pixels apart: the evanescent field of one reaches into the other, so light launched into fibre A crosses over into fibre B and back along the length, a directional coupler. The probe along A shows the beating, the cross-fibre probe the field across both cores. Switch source A off and B on to launch from the other fibre.

## The Add part menu

![menu-add-part](Assets/menu-add-part.svg)

The Add part menu of the project tree: the kinds of optical parts.

1. **Lens/Mirror**
   A lens or a mirror: a strip of the diameter between two spherical surfaces, each bulging outward, flat or hollow by the sign of its radius, the centre thickness apart. As a mirror it reflects everything; as a lens it refracts by its index, with an anti-reflection coating and absorption if wanted.
2. **Fibre**
   A fibre: a core of higher index inside a cladding, along a smooth path of Bézier segments through its nodes, with flat or round ends. A wave coupled into the core is guided along the path; the cladding can absorb stray light at its rim.
3. **Bragg reflector**
   A Bragg reflector: pairs of layers of two indices stacked along the axis. It reflects strongly around the wavelength the layer thicknesses are tuned to, a quarter wave each, and passes others.
4. **GRIN lens**
   A gradient-index lens: a rectangle whose index falls from the axis to the edge in a parabolic profile, so it focuses like a lens with flat faces.
5. **Zone plate**
   A zone plate: Fresnel zones cut for a design frequency and a focal length, every second zone an absorbing block, the central zone open or, inverted, a block. It focuses by diffraction; an optional mount stops light passing outside the diameter.
6. **Polygon**
   A regular polygon of glass or mirror, by its number of sides and the side length.
7. **Rectangle**
   A rectangle of glass or mirror, by length and width; linked, a square. A flat mirror is a long, narrow one.
8. **Ellipse**
   An ellipse of glass or mirror, by the length and width of its box; linked, a circle.
9. **Triangle**
   A triangle of glass or mirror: the base across the axis, the apex along it, the base angles set by a preset or by hand.
10. **Outline**
    A free outline of glass or mirror: a closed shape through the points you place and drag; fewer than three paint nothing.
11. **Optical logic**

## Add part > Optical logic

![menu-add-part-logic](Assets/menu-add-part-logic.svg)

The Optical logic submenu of the Add part menu: the gates.

1. **XOR (Mach-Zehnder)**
   An optical XOR gate: two input waveguides, a phase section putting the lower input a quarter period ahead, and a coupler whose upper output carries their difference. It lights when one input is lit, not both, for coherent inputs at the design frequency.
2. **AND**
   An optical AND gate: the same coupler with the lower input a quarter period behind, so the upper output carries the sum. It is brightest with both inputs lit, about four times a single one; a passive linear gate has no truer AND.
3. **OR**
   An optical OR gate: the same coupler with the lower input a twelfth of a period ahead, so the upper output carries half the power of either input and of both. It lights with one input or both.

## Lens

![properties-lens](Assets/properties-lens.svg)

A lens or a mirror: a strip of the diameter between two spherical surfaces, each bulging outward, flat or hollow by the sign of its radius, the centre thickness apart. As a mirror it reflects everything; as a lens it refracts by its index, with an anti-reflection coating and absorption if wanted.

1. **Description of the kind, opened and closed with Space; one setting for every kind**
   Show or hide what this kind of part is
2. **Name**
   Name shown in the project tree and on the canvas.
3. **Enabled**
   Paint the part into the scene; a disabled part has no effect on a run.
4. **X**
   X of the part's centre in canvas pixels.
5. **Y**
   Y of the part's centre in canvas pixels.
6. **Angle**
   Rotation about the centre in degrees, counter-clockwise on the screen. 0 points the part's axis to the right.
7. **Mirror**
   Make the part a mirror instead of a lens. The refractive index, the coating and the absorption are ignored then.
8. **Refractive index**
   Refractive index of the glass, 1.00 to 2.55 in steps of 0.01.
9. **AR coating**
   Thickness in pixels of the anti-reflection band just inside the outline; 0 for none. A quarter-wave layer is λ / (4 √n) pixels thick, λ being the wavelength the source form shows; a graded band is the better the thicker, from a wavelength on.
10. **Coating profile**
    How the index runs through the band: a layer at √n, the quarter-wave idea, or a graded rise from the medium outside to the glass. A graded band reflects less than a layer once it is a wavelength thick or more, at any wavelength; a layer only at the wavelength it is cut for.
11. **Coat the front**
    Put the band on the front: the faces turned toward a source on the left, a lens's first surface. Clear it to leave them bare, as the inner faces of a cavity are.
12. **Coat the back**
    Put the band on the back: the faces turned away from a source on the left, a lens's second surface. Clear it to leave them bare.
13. **Coat the sides**
    Put the band on the sides: the faces that are neither front nor back, a lens's rim, a slab's narrow ends. Clear it to leave them bare.
14. **Absorption**
    How strongly the part absorbs waves, 0 (not at all) to 255, as the scene image's blue channel. It rises from nothing at the outline over the absorption ramp, so a wave enters the part instead of being reflected. A mirror ignores it.
15. **Absorption ramp**
    Depth in pixels over which the absorption rises from nothing at the outline to its full value; the longer, the less of a wave is reflected. A part thinner than twice the ramp reaches its full absorption in its middle.
16. **Diameter**
    Extent across the axis in pixels.
17. **Concave (diverging)**
    Whether the lens diverges, its surfaces curving inward. Ticking it turns the lens around by flipping the sign of both radii; a flat surface stays flat.
18. **R1**
    Radius of the first surface in pixels: positive bulges outward, negative is concave, 0 is flat. A radius too curved for the diameter and the centre thickness is raised to the smallest that fits.
19. **R2**
    Radius of the second surface in pixels: negative bulges outward, positive is concave, 0 is flat. A radius too curved for the diameter and the centre thickness is raised to the smallest that fits.
20. **Centre thickness**

1. **Description of the kind, opened and closed with Space; one setting for every kind**
   Show or hide what this kind of part is
2. **Name**
   Name shown in the project tree and on the canvas.
3. **Enabled**
   Paint the part into the scene; a disabled part has no effect on a run.
4. **X**
   X of the part's centre in canvas pixels.
5. **Y**
   Y of the part's centre in canvas pixels.
6. **Angle**
   Rotation about the centre in degrees, counter-clockwise on the screen. 0 points the part's axis to the right.
7. **Mirror**
   Make the part a mirror instead of glass. The refractive index, the coating and the absorption are ignored then.
8. **Refractive index**
   Refractive index of the glass, 1.00 to 2.55 in steps of 0.01.
9. **AR coating**
   Thickness in pixels of the anti-reflection band just inside the outline; 0 for none. A quarter-wave layer is λ / (4 √n) pixels thick, λ being the wavelength the source form shows; a graded band is the better the thicker, from a wavelength on.
10. **Coating profile**
    How the index runs through the band: a layer at √n, the quarter-wave idea, or a graded rise from the medium outside to the glass. A graded band reflects less than a layer once it is a wavelength thick or more, at any wavelength; a layer only at the wavelength it is cut for.
11. **Coat the front**
    Put the band on the front: the faces turned toward a source on the left, a lens's first surface. Clear it to leave them bare, as the inner faces of a cavity are.
12. **Coat the back**

13. **Coat the sides**

14. **Absorption**
    How strongly the part absorbs waves, 0 (not at all) to 255, as the scene image's blue channel. It rises from nothing at the outline over the absorption ramp, so a wave enters the part instead of being reflected. A mirror ignores it.
15. **Absorption ramp**
    Depth in pixels over which the absorption rises from nothing at the outline to its full value; the longer, the less of a wave is reflected. A part thinner than twice the ramp reaches its full absorption in its middle.
16. **Number of sides**
    Number of sides, 3 to 64.
17. **Side length**
    Length of each side in pixels.

## OR gate

![properties-or-gate](Assets/properties-or-gate.svg)

An optical OR gate: the same coupler with the lower input a twelfth of a period ahead, so the upper output carries half the power of either input and of both. It lights with one input or both.

1. **Description of the kind, opened and closed with Space; one setting for every kind**
   Show or hide what this kind of part is
2. **Name**
   Name shown in the project tree and on the canvas.
3. **Enabled**
   Paint the part into the scene; a disabled part has no effect on a run.
4. **X**
   X of the part's centre in canvas pixels.
5. **Y**
   Y of the part's centre in canvas pixels.
6. **Angle**
   Rotation about the centre in degrees, counter-clockwise on the screen. 0 points the part's axis to the right.
7. **Design frequency**
   The source frequency the gate is designed for, on the same scale as a source's frequency: the frequency of the sources that drive it. The wavelength, and from it the core width, the coupler and the phase section, follow from it, so the gate works at this frequency only.
8. **Wavelength**
   The wavelength the design frequency gives in a medium of index 1, with the simulation's source frequency scale
9. **Core index**
   Refractive index of the waveguide cores, 1.00 to 2.55 in steps of 0.01. It must be above the cladding's; the larger the difference, the narrower the cores and the tighter the bends.
10. **Cladding index**
    Refractive index of the cladding around the cores, 1.00 to 2.55 in steps of 0.01.
11. **AR coating**
    Thickness in pixels of the anti-reflection band at the ends ticked below, with the index √n of the core and of the cladding; 0 for none. A quarter-wave band, the least reflecting, is λ / (4 √n) pixels thick; the form shows it for the core.
12. **AR on input side**
    Put the anti-reflection band on the input end. Switch it off where the gate takes its light from a gate before it, so the wave passes through the junction.
13. **AR on output side**
    Put the anti-reflection band on the output end. Switch it off where the gate hands its light to a gate after it, so the wave passes through the junction.
14. **Quarter-wave coating**
    The thickness of the least reflecting coating on the core, λ / (4 √n)
15. **Port spacing**
    Distance between the two inputs, and between the two outputs, in pixels. A value below what the design needs to keep the arms apart is raised to it, and the box shows the spacing used.
16. **Upper output**
    Let the upper output's light leave the gate. Switched off, an absorber with a soft rise takes it in the last stretch of the arm.
17. **Lower output**
    Let the lower output's light leave the gate. Switched off, an absorber with a soft rise takes it in the last stretch of the arm.
18. **Core width**

## Zone plate

![properties-zone-plate](Assets/properties-zone-plate.svg)

A zone plate: Fresnel zones cut for a design frequency and a focal length, every second zone an absorbing block, the central zone open or, inverted, a block. It focuses by diffraction; an optional mount stops light passing outside the diameter.

1. **Description of the kind, opened and closed with Space; one setting for every kind**
   Show or hide what this kind of part is
2. **Name**
   Name shown in the project tree and on the canvas.
3. **Enabled**
   Paint the part into the scene; a disabled part has no effect on a run.
4. **X**
   X of the part's centre in canvas pixels.
5. **Y**
   Y of the part's centre in canvas pixels.
6. **Angle**
   Rotation about the centre in degrees, counter-clockwise on the screen. 0 points the part's axis to the right.
7. **Target frequency**
   The source frequency the plate is designed for, on the same scale as a source's frequency. The zones follow from the wavelength it gives, so the plate focuses this frequency at the focal length; other frequencies focus elsewhere.
8. **Wavelength**
   The wavelength the design frequency gives in a medium of index 1, with the simulation's source frequency scale
9. **Focal length**
   Distance in pixels from the plate to its focus, for a plane wave arriving along the axis.
10. **Inverse**
    Exchange the zones: the central zone becomes a block, the first ring open, and so on. The focus stays where it is.
11. **Diameter**
    Extent across the axis in pixels; the zones fill it.
12. **Thickness**
    Extent along the axis in pixels: the depth of the blocks. It should leave room for the anti-reflection rise on both faces.
13. **Anti-reflection**
    Depth in pixels over which a block's absorption rises from nothing at its faces to its full strength, so the blocks reflect little; at most half the thickness takes effect.
14. **Mount**
    Surround the plate with an absorbing mount, so no light passes outside its diameter. Without it, that light meets the focused light on the axis and moves the focus further out, the more so the fewer zones the plate has.
15. **Mount width**
    Width in pixels of the absorbing mount on either side, beyond the diameter.
16. **Number of zones**
17. **Outermost zone**
